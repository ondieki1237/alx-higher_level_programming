# 0x08-python-more_classes
## Overview
This project is an introduction to the concepts of object-oriented programming in Python. It covers the basic principles of class and object creation, as well as special methods and attributes, such as __init__, __str__, __repr__, and __del__.

### Class and Object Creation
The first step in creating a class is to define the class structure. In Python, classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name.


* __init__: This method is called when an object is created and is used to initialize the object's attributes.
* __str__: This method is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object.
* __repr__: This method is used to define an unambiguous string representation of an object, typically used for debugging purposes.
* __del__: This method is called when an object is about to be destroyed and is used to free resources that are not automatically managed by the system.

## Attributes
An attribute is a variable that is associated with an object. Attributes can be defined in the __init__ method and can be accessed using the dot notation.
